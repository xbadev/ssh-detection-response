Command:
python3 detector/ssh-bruteforce-detector.py --input logs/sample-auth.log -t 3 -w 20

Output:
[INFO] Parsed 10 failed login attempts from logs/sample-auth.log
[ALERT] Detected 2 brute-force source(s):
- IP 192.168.56.30 had 3 failures between 2026-01-08 06:37:28 and 2026-01-08 06:37:47
- IP 192.168.56.1 had 3 failures between 2026-01-08 01:32:23 and 2026-01-08 01:32:23

Notes:
- Detection is sensitive to threshold and window tuning
- Short windows reduce false positives
- Grouping by source IP correctly identifies attacker behavior
