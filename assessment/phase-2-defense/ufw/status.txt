UFW Status Verification

Command executed:
sudo ufw status verbose

Observed result:
- UFW is enabled and actively enforcing rules.
- Default incoming policy is deny.
- SSH access is explicitly allowed from the host-only network.

Key takeaway:
The firewall is now actively filtering traffic at the kernel level.
Only explicitly allowed sources can reach SSH on port 22.

This confirms that the system has moved from an exposed baseline
to an enforced perimeter control.
