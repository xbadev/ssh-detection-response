UFW Rule Configuration

Rule added:
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any port 22

Explanation:
- Allows SSH access only from the trusted host-only network.
- Prevents SSH access from external or unintended networks.
- Maintains administrative access while reducing attack surface.

Security impact:
- SSH is no longer globally reachable.
- Network segmentation is enforced at the firewall level.
- Reduces risk of lateral movement and brute-force exposure.

This rule supports the defense-in-depth strategy for SSH hardening.
