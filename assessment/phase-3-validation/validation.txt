Phase 3 validates that SSH defenses applied in Phase 2 are effective.

Validation steps:
- Attacker (Kali) attempts SSH access to Ubuntu after defenses are enabled
- Ubuntu logs authentication failures
- Fail2Ban detects repeated failures
- Attacker IP is banned
- SSH access from attacker is blocked

Expected behavior:
- SSH authentication fails
- Attacker IP is listed as banned
- Further SSH connections are refused

Observed result:
- Kali IP (192.168.56.30) was banned by Fail2Ban
- SSH connections from Kali were refused
- Defense mechanisms functioned as intended
