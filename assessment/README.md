# Security Assessment: Attack → Observe → Defend → Validate

This assessment builds on the existing Kali–Ubuntu dual-NIC homelab to simulate a realistic security workflow.

The goal is to demonstrate how an exposed service can be:
- Observed under attack
- Actively defended
- Validated after controls are applied

## Assessment Phases
- Phase 0: Baseline access verification
- Phase 1: Simulated attack from Kali
- Phase 2: Defensive controls (fail2ban, firewall)
- Phase 3: Validation and confirmation of protection
