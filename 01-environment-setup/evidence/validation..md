# Connectivity Validation

The following checks were performed to validate network and access configuration:

## Internal Network (Host-Only)
- Host → Kali: ICMP ping successful
- Host → Ubuntu: ICMP ping successful
- Kali → Ubuntu: ICMP ping successful

## SSH Access
- Host → Kali: SSH login successful
- Host → Ubuntu: SSH login successful
- Kali → Ubuntu: SSH login successful

All tests confirm correct internal segmentation and controlled access between systems.
